# 2D-Platform
A 2D tilemap platformer made in Unity while following the GameDev.TV Unity 2D Class

# What I learned from this part of the course:
* Using many levels of tilemap and define rule tiles to paint the level automatically.
* How to make different entieties interact together with collissions.
* Tuning for player speed, maximum jump, level design and flow etc...

# What I customized/added:
* Climbing animation for the player with grabbing feature towards ladders.
* Added a little bit of level transition with fade in and fade out animation.
* Personalized exit: the player goes through the exit only after a certain amount of time has passed (after having pressed continuosly the interact button).
